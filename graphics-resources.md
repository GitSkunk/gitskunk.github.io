# Graphics Resources for Gamedev

## Level Design

[OGMO](http://www.ogmoeditor.com/) - A pretty neat little editor. Fairly flexible. Free. If you use HaxeFlixel, there's a helper class to load OGMO stuff in Flixel-addons. Just use FlxOgmoLoader.

[Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) -  Another tile based map editor. Also pretty nice and free.

[DAME](http://dambots.com/dame-editor/) - Yet another map editor. Runs with Adobe AIR. Free and quite capable.


## General Painting

[Photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/) -  Everyone knows about this. :)

[Krita](https://krita.org/) - A much less well known image editor with a bent towards artistic work rather than technical image editing. Free.

[Paint.NET](http://paint.net/) - And another well known editor. Free.

[Gimp](http://www.getpaint.net/) - And more well known stuff. Free as well.


## Sprites

[GraphicGale](http://www.humanbalance.net/gale/us/) - Comes in free and shareware version, freeware is entirely usable for most purposes though.

[GrafX2](http://pulkomandy.tk/projects/GrafX2) - Program specializing in pixel art. Probably good for both sprites and backgrounds if you want a retro look.

[Piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com/) -Simple online sprite editor.


## Fonts

[Littera](http://kvazars.com/littera/) - Handy online tool for converting fonts over to bitmaps for use. (Pack method 6 seems to be the best).

[DaFont](http://www.dafont.com/) - Font site. Has a custom preview though, so you could easily use this to make simple text bitmaps for static text.
